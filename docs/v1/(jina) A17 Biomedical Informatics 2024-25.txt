## 5. Brief description of the subject and syllabus 

5.1. Brief description of the subject 

An often-cited definition of the area has been proposed by Ted Shortliffe: The rapidly developing scientific field that deals with the storage, retrieval, and optimal use of biomedical information, data, and knowledge for problem solving and decision making. It accordingly touches on all basic and applied fields in biomedical science and is closely tied to modern information technologies, notably in the areas of computing and communications. Many areas have been established, including topics such as decision support systems, electronic health records, hospital information systems, data and text mining, information retrieval, bibliographic systems, medical imaging, etc. Over the last 20 years, new areas have been introduced, such as merging medical informatics with bioinformatics, into what is called biomedical informatics. Then, areas such as translational bioinformatics have emerged. Fundamental new topics include precision medicine, Web-based applications, the introduction of social networks, biomedical ontologies, semantic interoperability, Big Data research and others. We emphasize topics of biomedical informatics related to artificial Intelligence, such as ontologies, machine learning, text mining or knowledge-based systems. Over the last years, particularly after the introduction of ChatGPT and other Large Language Models into the mainstream of AI, a strong need for ethical considerations of different aspects has appeared, enhanced by national and international organizations. We will analyze the limitations of those AI systems, their ethical considerations, and other related issues. 

5.2. Syllabus 

1. Introduction 1.1. Biomedical informatics: the concept. 1.2. Historical analysis of biomedical informatics development since the 50s. 1.3.
